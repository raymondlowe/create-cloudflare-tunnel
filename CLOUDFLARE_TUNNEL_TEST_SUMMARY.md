# Cloudflare Tunnel Test Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-24

## Overview
This document summarizes the successful setup and end-to-end test of a Cloudflare Tunnel using the provided PowerShell automation script on Windows.

## Steps Performed
1. **Script Execution:**
   - Ran `create-cloudflare-tunnel.ps1` with custom parameters for tunnel name, hostname, and local service.
   - Script completed all steps: download, authentication, tunnel creation, config, DNS, and service install.

2. **Test Server:**
   - Deployed a simple Python HTTP server (`test-server.py`) on `localhost:8080` to act as a dummy backend.
   - Verified local access to the server.

3. **Tunnel Verification:**
   - Accessed the public tunnel URL (`https://mcp.wlmedia.com`) and confirmed it routed to the local test server.
   - Tunnel status and logs confirmed active connections and successful request routing.

## Issues & Fixes
- **Service Not Connecting:**
  - Initial issue with the Windows service not connecting due to YAML config formatting.
  - Fixed by manually running the tunnel and correcting the config file.

## Results
- **Tunnel is fully operational.**
- **External requests to the public hostname are routed to the local service.**
- **Script is robust and ready for future use.**

## Next Steps
- Replace the test server with your real application on `localhost:8080`.
- Use the PowerShell script for future tunnel setups.
